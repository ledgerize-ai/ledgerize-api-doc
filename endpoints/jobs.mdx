## Status
`GET /api/v1/jobs/{jobId}`

Returns job status and progress.

## Result
`GET /api/v1/jobs/{jobId}/result`

Returns the converted data. For `JSON`, the response is JSON; for `CSV`/`XLS`, a file download.

### Notes

- If you request the result before the job completes, you'll get a `409 NOT_READY`.
- Jobs are ephemeral; fetch results soon after completion (job status and result may not be retained indefinitely).
